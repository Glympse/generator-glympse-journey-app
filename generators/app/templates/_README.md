#Glympse Journey - <%= appname %> 
=================================

A project based on the [Glympse Journey Core](http://github.com/Glympse/glympse-journey-core)
module. For more information on how to use the GJC, refer to its link for additional
documentation.

To get fully set up with an initial workable app, you need to build it first. To do
this (and for all subsequent builds) in the root directory type: ```grunt```

`grunt` builds land in `dist/` and `builds/_version_number_`, and also update the
`app.css` file found in `app/css`. All CSS updates should be done via SCSS. Reference
.scss files can be found in `app/css/scss`.
